					<aside class="notes">The types of scenarios considered in many web performance studies/examples are really clean slate/pie in the sky scenarios that don't acknowledge the constraints within which we as devs operate. Sometimes you don't have a great deal of control over asset delivery, your application requires long asynchronous processes that cannot be easily improved, etc. We sell ourselves short by focusing on improving objective time when we can sometimes make much greater strides to how fast our apps &amp; sites *feel* without improving their actual speed at all.</aside>

						Tremendous body of research into how humans perceive time, but very little of it has been specifically angled at understanding computer interfaces. A scientist(?) named David Maister composed a list of prinicples that generally describe how humans perceive waits. Some of them are particularly applicable, and we can use these as a guide to take steps that make our creations feel faster. 4 Uns.

					<aside class="notes">
						If you know there's going to be a long wait, let the be clear and allow them to opt in.  If you make it the user's choice, you give them agency and the wait feels shorter.

						Everyone's had an experience ordering a meal that's supposed to be quick, and when it takes forever it's *extra* annoying. When expecting something quick and it takes a long time, you're violating user's trust and defying their expectation.  They haven't mentally prepared for the wait involved, and so they're left watching the proverbial tea kettle.

						Use active states so users can be certain their action was registered. They get instantaneous feedback and the app feels faster.

						Honestly?  Someone much smarter than me could probably give an entire talk on progress bars alone. Progress bars with a counter running band animation have the appearance of running faster [[TODO MEDIA: include anim]]
