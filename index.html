					<aside class="notes">The types of scenarios considered in many web performance studies/examples are really clean slate/pie in the sky scenarios that don't acknowledge the constraints within which we as devs operate. Sometimes you don't have a great deal of control over asset delivery, your application requires long asynchronous processes that cannot be easily improved, etc. We sell ourselves short by focusing on improving objective time when we can sometimes make much greater strides to how fast our apps &amp; sites *feel* without improving their actual speed at all.</aside>

						Think of waiting for food. Hemming and hawwing deciding what you want to eat doesn't really feel like time stretches on for ages, but waiting for a server to bring your food somehow does.

						Riding your bike a half hour to work can seem shorter than a 20 minute drive spent sitting in traffic.

						On the web, the distinction can be filling out a form, and waiting for your order to be approved. Or choosing your where to place your rideshare pin, and waiting for your car to arrive.

					TODO: fix this and the following sections probably?

					Tremendous body of research into how humans perceive time, but very little of it has been specifically angled at understanding computer interfaces. A scientist(?) named David Maister composed a list of prinicples that generally describe how humans perceive waits. Some of them are particularly applicable, and we can use these as a guide to take steps that make our creations feel faster. 4 Uns.</aside>

						Everyone's had an experience ordering a meal that's supposed to be quick, and when it takes forever it's *extra* annoying. When expecting something quick and it takes a long time, you're violating user's trust and defying their expectation.  They haven't mentally prepared for the wait involved, and so they're left watching the proverbial tea kettle.
